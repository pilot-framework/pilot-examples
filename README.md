# Example Project

A "project" represents the top-level logical entity, while "applications" represent distinct entities that can be deployed individually. For more information, you can see [Waypoint's documentation](https://www.waypointproject.io/docs/waypoint-hcl).

This repository represents a 1:1 mapping of a project to a repository. Typically, you'll have one `waypoint.hcl` file at the top-level of your project, which defines the applications contained within. In this case, we have four applications we can deploy - each one has their own README with more information.
